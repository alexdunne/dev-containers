# Dev Containers Proof of Concept

- `git clone` the repo
- Open VS Code and install [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Open the Command Palette and select `Remote-Containers: Open folder in container...`
- Select the current project

## Findings

- Super simple to get started. Worth trying bash setup commands locally first otherwise the feedback loop can be a bit long
- Some existing extensions stay enabled but being able to pass a list of ones to install is super handy
- Debugging _just works_. Added a breakpoint and started the debugger with `f5` ezpz
